BasicJavaScriptGame
===================

Hello!

This is a basic JavaScript game that is completely **text-based**. All beginners, intermediate and experts are free to join this project. Your knowledge has to be slightly vast, since it requires the ability to understand Objects. Hopefully that's not a problem for you. :)

List of coders:

1. Javaliant - *JavaScript Developer* <br>
2. Yazid (**A.K.A** Alabaster456) - *JavaScript Developer* <br>
3. Jadog1 - Leader of project, as well as a *JavaScript Developer*<br>

P.S. If you don't quite understand objects but at least understand how functions work it's fine, read the F.A.Q. at the top of the js file it should be easy to add story/make enemies/run battles.
